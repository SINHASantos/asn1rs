//! This module contains defines traits to encode and decode basic ASN.1 primitives and types of
//! which the encoding/decoding depends on the UNALIGNED flag.
//! The idea is to provide all building blocks to composite the more complex types on top of the
//! traits without caring about the representation being ALIGNED or UNALIGNED.
